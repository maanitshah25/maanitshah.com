Hello everyone,

I have been wanting to make a personal portfolio website for myself for a long time. 
After 2 weeks of rigorous procrastination I finally got myself to open VSC on my laptop and get to work.
This website showcases some interesting facts about myself as well as my achievements and skills.
I am very happy to have finally made my own website and hope you guys like it.
Suggestions and recommendations are always welcome!!

ATTENTION — If you’re viewing this on your phone, please switch to your laptop as the website isn’t optimized for mobile devices just yet!
